🌍 Data Science & Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to this repository — a space created to help beginners dive into the world of data!

This project is dedicated to those taking their first steps in Data Science and Machine Learning, aiming to provide clear, practical examples and explanations through shared code, personal insights, and learning notes.

🎯 Goal

The main goal of this repository is to help beginners in the Data Science field by sharing my own code, experiments, and perspectives on various topics. It focuses on understanding and using the core tools of the trade — Python and its powerful libraries such as:

🐼 Pandas – for data manipulation and analysis

🔢 NumPy – for numerical computing

🤖 Scikit-learn – for machine learning models and preprocessing

🔥 PyTorch and 🧠 TensorFlow – for building and training deep learning models

Each project or notebook aims to show what these tools do, how they work, and what they stand for in real-world data applications.

🚀 What You’ll Find

Step-by-step, commented pipelines demonstrating complete data workflows

Machine Learning algorithms implemented with Scikit-learn

Deep Neural Networks built with PyTorch and TensorFlow

Continuous updates as I expand the repository with new examples and learning materials over time

I’ll be updating this repository regularly, adding new projects and insights as I continue learning and exploring new topics in Data Science.

Thanks for visiting! You’re more than welcome to share your feedback or suggestions — I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas.
